INTRODUCTION                                    *lose*

This plugin can be used if vim's 'path' option has been set.

COMMANDS                                        *lose-commands*
These commands work based on the 'path' option regardless of the current working
directory.

                                                *lose-:Lose*
:Lose [fileName]        Functionally equivalent to vim's built-in find command
                        with a few differences. First, if multiple files match
                        the search, the user selects which one to open. Second,
                        globbing is supported so "*.txt" is a valid query.

ABOUT                                           *lose-about*

Since this is a work in progress, there is still much more to do. Feel free to
to fork this project and hack away!
